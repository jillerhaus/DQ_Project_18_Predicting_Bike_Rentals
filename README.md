# DataQuest Project 18: Predicting Bike Rentals Using Machine Learning

This is the 18th project I completed in the "Data Analyst in Python" and "Data Scientist in Python" paths from Dataquest. In this project a dataset containing historic data on bike rentals in Washington D.C. was used to train and test a linear regression model, a decision tree model and a random forest model to try to predict the number of rentals.

The educational goal of the project was to understand how using a model with high complexity can lead to overfitting in certain models such as decision trees and how influencing the model by changing the parameters of the model can result in a model that generalizes much better.

## Prerequisites

This project requires both the Jupyter notebook as well as the `CSV` file containing data on previous bike rentals.

To run this project, you will need `Jupyter Notebooks` with a python 3 kernel to be installed on your machine. Instructions on how to install `Jupyter Notebooks` can be found on the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install).

The project itself is written in Python 3 and uses the modules `Numpy`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`, `seaborn` and `Pandas`, ` to run. These can be installed by running `pip install <name of module>` in the console.
